Spring Boot
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Spring Boot offers convention over configuration.
Spring Boot offers auto-configuration.

Spring Boot benefits over Spring:
1. Dependency Resolution
2. Minimum Configuration
3. Embedded Server for Testing
4. Bean Auto Scan
5. Health Metrics

@Conditional
@Configuration

@SpringBootApplication = @Configuration + @EnableAutoConfiguration + @ComponentScan

Microservices and its architecture
Microservices enable loose coupling
Individual deployment

Drawbacks of monolithic approach:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Single war file deployed to server
1. Performance issue due to huge data
2. Continuous Deployment is not possible
3. Adopting new technology is difficult
4. No proper Exception propagation
5. Code reeadability is difficult
